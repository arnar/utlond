Previous education
------------------

**M.Sc. in Computer Science**, Reykjavik University, graduate year 2009.

**B.Sc. in Mathematics**, University of Iceland, graduate year 2004.

M.Sc. Thesis work
-----------------

My MSc thesis is titled [Topics in Structural Operational Semantics](projects/msc-thesis) 
and was submitted and defended in May 2009. The link above leads to a PDF version of the thesis as well as my 
presentation slide deck. The thesis presents three independent projects; an implementation and semantics of 
Transactional Memory Introspection in Haskell and SOS, decompositionality results for a process algebra and 
logic which includes a detailed notion of computation history and SOS rule formats for determinism and idempotency.

My supervisor is [Luca Aceto](http://www.ru.is/luca/)

Current research interests
--------------------------

My current M.Sc. thesis work and related research are in process algebra. Other interests include concurrency 
theory in general, programming languages, type theory, use of logic in computer science and modelling and verification.

On the practical side I am interested in paradigms for concurrent programming such as asynchronous message passing 
systems, software transactional memory and other alternatives and extensions to shared-memory threads. Also 
(programming/domain-specific) language processing, compiler construction and dynamic programming environments.

Going outside the scope of my education I also have a weak spot for electronics of all sorts, playing microprocessors 
and [general DIY hacking](http://www.hackaday.com/).

Teaching
--------

I have previously been a TA for the following courses at RU.

Spring 2008: *Algorithm design and analysis*, T-604-HGRE. Administered weekly excercise sessions.
             2nd-3rd year elective course of B.Sc. in CS.

Spring 2008: *Computer Science II* (3-week intensive course). Administered daily excercise sessions 
             and helped with course design (first-time Python was used). 1st year of engineering programs.

Spring 2009: *Introduction to Aritificial Intelligence*. Administer weekly lab sessions and compose assignments 
             and teaching material for AI programming in LISP, Prolog and others.

Personal stuff
--------------

Besides all that CS and programming nonsense I enjoy photography, as witnessed on 
[my Flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arnarbi), driving around 
[my beautiful country](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=iceland%20landscape&w=all) in my jeep and playing 
the piano (well, pretending to play at least).

Besides flickr, I'm also to be found in various online places:

Georg Brandl generously allowed me to steal his CSS and design ideas from the 
[Pygments website](http://www.pygments.org/), thanks Georg! Pygments also handles the highlighting of all code on this site.
